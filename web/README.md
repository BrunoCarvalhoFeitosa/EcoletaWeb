## The project

This project is made with Node.js and SQLite to backend and made with React.js to frontend. And your proposal is connect peoples with recycling points. In it, it is possible to register the data of the recycling point where a trader can register and show people that at that point he collects plastic, paper and cardboard, organic materials and much more, thus creating a safe place for the waste already used and possibly discarded in inappropriate places.

### `yarn dev` to backend

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) to view it in the browser, this command will run the application backend and save the information in the database


### `yarn start` to frontend 
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser, this command will run the application in web browser and will present the interface for inerting.

### `API`
To test the API, I personally recommend the Insomnia (https://insomnia.rest/download/) software, it is very intent and easy to test software, visually demonstrates the status of the returned routes.
